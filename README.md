To detect a human face 
Face detection is a computer technology being used in a variety of applications that identifies human faces in digital images.Face detection also refers to the psychological process by which humans locate and attend to faces in a visual scene.
Face-detection algorithms focus on the detection of frontal human faces. It is analogous to image detection in which the image of a person is matched bit by bit. Image matches with the image stores in database. Any facial feature changes in the database will invalidate the matching process.
